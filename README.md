## Use

### Storyboards

Simply pin a constraint to the bottom of your view and the scrollview that wraps your textinput. Override the NSLayoutconstraint as 'NYSKeyboardHelper'. And that's it. It should automatically shrink your scrollview to not go under your keyboard.

Add some 'extra indent' in the properties of the constraint to have a bit of margin between your containerview and the view.

### Code

```swift
let keyboardConstraint = NYSKeyboardHelper(item: self.view, attribute: .bottom, relatedBy: .equal, toItem: scrollView, attribute: .bottom, multiplier: 1.0, constant: 0.0)
keyboardConstraint.extraIndent = 10.0
self.view.addConstraint(keyboardConstraint)
```
set the 'extraIndent' property to have more margin between your containerview and the view.
